# Overview

Are you trying to save money or pay off your debt, but don't know how much to spend every month?

Well this app will help you follow the 50-30-20 percent rule. You'll be prompted to enter your monthly income, and based off that income it'll tell you how much you should spend on needs, wants, and how much to save/pay off debt every month.

This app is to help you save and use your money wisely!
